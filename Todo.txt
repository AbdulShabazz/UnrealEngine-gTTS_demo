TODO: Generate the formant F0 excitation signal and then use stochastic rules- and event-based signal generation cues (parametric Hidden Markov Model HMM) for phoneme to mel spectrogram generation
TODO: Generate the excitation tone, white noise, and the pitch curve and then mix them (via a convolve filter) into a desired phone
